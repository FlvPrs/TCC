Failed to create Convex Mesh from source mesh "LVL01_SetorAB_FaltaTerminarTexturadeNinho:InstrumentoTorre_NinhoAcustico03". Source mesh is likely have too many smooth surface regions. Please reduce the surface smoothness of the source mesh. Alternatively turn on Inflate Mesh and increase the Skin Width sufficiently for this mesh.
